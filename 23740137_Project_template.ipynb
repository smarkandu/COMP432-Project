The data set was obtained via Kaggle, and contains the necessary images which can be used for both training the model and then finally testing it.  CNNs was used in implementing this.  \n","\n","The main challenges include having enough data to sufficiently test/train my model.  A huge challenge will be in researching a sufficient machine learning model(s) different from CNN in order to accomplish the same task.  And finally, fine-tuning our model in order to achieve the best performance weâ€™re able to achieve.  \n","\n","The performance metrics include:*italicized text*\n","\n","*   Accuracy\n","*   Error\n","*   Loss per epoch (using CrossEntropyLoss)\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"MP7fynuIMGlg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **1.0 Introduction**\n","\n","Given a hand drawn circuit component diagram, the model should be able to classify what kind of circuit component this is. This is crucial, as every person has their own way of drawing each component. Since a circuit component is valid in any orientation (unlike alphanumeric symbols for example), the model needs to be able to recognize a given component regardless of orientation. \n","\n","Some similar problems include the following:\n","\n","* Lab Week 5 - Convolutional Neural Networks\n","* Another CNN example (this one involving shapes)\n","* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/reevald/geometric-shapes-mathematics\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"wBGDBctaMYYQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **2.0 Methodology**\n","\n","##2.1 Preprocessing\n","\n","##2.2 Model Aspects"],"metadata":{"id":"XtzOOJDnMpWp"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **3.0 Experimental Setup**\n","# 3.1 Hyperparameter Tuning\n"],"metadata":{"id":"YIQOcLeaPq3v"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!python ./src/train.py --lr=0.001 --epochs=3 --batchsize=64 --neurons=20 --eval='True'"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"EkjhgZXgWbKP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1681787684306,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":325,"user":{"displayName":"Steven Markandu","userId":"11656348305876002039"}},"outputId":"49a04c37-90ce-4b02-8f4d-f965815a8699"},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["python3: can't open file '/content/./src/train.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"q9-88mMeWatP"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **4.0 Experimental Results**\n","Describe here the main experimental results.
